# problem 
## Introduction
Millions of people commute by car every day; for example, to school or to their workplace.
Self-driving vehicles are an exciting development for transportation. They aim to make traveling by car safer
and more available while also saving commuters time.
In this competition problem, weâ€™ll be looking at how a fleet of self-driving vehicles can efficiently get
commuters to their destinations in a simulated city.
## Task
Given a list of pre-booked rides in a city and a fleet of self-driving vehicles, assign the rides to vehicles, so
that riders get to their destinations on time.
For every ride that finishes on time (or early), you will earn points
